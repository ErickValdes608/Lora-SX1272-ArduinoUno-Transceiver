# Lora-SX1272-ArduinoUno-Transceiver

Based of [this example](https://github.com/ErtugrulKusva/Lora-SX127x-ESP32s-Arduino-Transceiver-Arduino-IDE-Code), this repo connects an Arduino Uno with the Semtech SX1272 mbed shield, the code has been updated to use the latest [RadioLib](https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib) version (5.7.0) and fixes the pinout according to the Arduino and SX1272 diagrams that also have been uploaded to the repository.
